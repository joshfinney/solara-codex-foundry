# Backend Workspace

This package groups the back-end adaptations that support the Primary Credit workspace.  
It intentionally starts small so that future PandasAI patches, FastAPI clients, and other
server-side tooling can live in a predictable place.

The area is ready for:
- PandasAI customisations tailored to issuance workflows.
- Service adapters that will transition to a dedicated FastAPI deployment.
- Reusable utilities for data preparation and secure credential handling.

Add new modules alongside this README as the integrations evolve.
